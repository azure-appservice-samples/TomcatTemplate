<h1>JSP
Samples</h1>
<p>This is a collection of samples demonstrating the usage of different
parts of the Java Server Pages (JSP) specification.  Both JSP 2.0 and
JSP 1.2 examples are presented below.
<p>These examples will only work when these pages are being served by a
servlet engine; of course, we recommend
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>.
They will not work if you are viewing these pages via a
"file://..." URL.
<p>To navigate your way through the examples, the following icons will
help:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
<li><img src="images/execute.gif" alt=""> Execute the example</li>
<li><img src="images/code.gif" alt=""> Look at the source code for the example</li>
<!-- <li><img src="images/read.gif" alt=""> Read more about this feature</li> -->
<li><img src="images/return.gif" alt=""> Return to this screen</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: For session scoped beans to work, the cookies must be enabled.
This can be done using browser options.</p>
